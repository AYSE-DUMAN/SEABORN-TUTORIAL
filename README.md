# Seaborn Tutorial with Iris Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of the **Seaborn** library in Python for data visualization. In this study, I visualize the famous **Iris dataset**, a multivariate dataset available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepals and petals for three species of iris flowers.

In this repository, I utilize various Seaborn visualization techniques to explore and present the dataset, including relational plots, scatter plots, pair plots, faceted plots, box plots, bar graphs, and density plots.

## Contents

- **Iris Dataset**: A brief introduction to the dataset, which includes the following features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

- **Visualizations**:
  - **Relational Plot**: Exploring relationships between different features.
  - **Two-Dimensional Plot**: Visualizing the data in 2D.
  - **Scatter Plot**: Plotting individual data points to show distribution.
  - **Pair Plot**: Pairwise relationships between features.
  - **Faceted Plot**: Visualizing data subsets using multiple subplots.
  - **Box Plot**: Displaying the distribution of the data, highlighting outliers.
  - **Bar Graph**: Visualizing categorical data such as species counts.
  - **Density Plot**: Showing the distribution of data in continuous variables.

## Libraries Used

- **Seaborn**: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library that simplifies working with data structures like DataFrames.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations in Python, particularly useful for handling arrays.
